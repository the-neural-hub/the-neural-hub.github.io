									<h2 style="color: azure;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="entry-summary">
									<p style="color: azure;">The one reason for the huge success of Machine Learning and
										Artificial Intelligence is the proper and effective use of the abundant valuable
										resource, the USER DATA. Before 2010, nobody even cared about Machine Learning
										or
										what
										neural networks were. But once we started obtaining great predictions and
										classification
										by the right use of data in the machine learning applications, now every
										industry is
										feeding it's data to such models to obtain better predictions and improve their
										business
										by making it more user-centric instead of being business centric.</p>
									<br>
									<p style="color: azure;">There are so many domains and use cases that use ML and AI
										today. Every industry
										makes
										use of it's data and improves the user experience by providing them with more
										specific
										solutions for their problems. Let it be an image search algorithm or auto
										complete
										algorithm or job search, the list goes on.</p>
									<br>

									<p style="color: azure;">
										Now we’ll discuss one such use case that made use of AI and ML to earn billions.
										The
										best
										in the social media industry. Yes, we are talking about Instagram. We’ll look
										into
										how
										Instagram makes use of the user data to provide better experience while using
										the
										application. Everything we do with the application is useful data to learn
										something
										about the user. Not only in Instagram, even in webpages the clicks we do, the
										things
										we
										select, each define our preferences and add up in the bucket of the user data.

								<div class="entry-summary" style="color: azure;">

									<h3 style="text-align:center">How does Instagram use your data?</h3><br>

									<h3>INTEREST</h3>
									<p>We usually see only contents that we like and that we usually want to see first.
										And
										there is a specific ordering of the posts we see in the feed. Who actually
										determines this feed order? Pretty straight forward. Some algorithm that runs in
										the
										back end server. But how is the order of the photos and videos determined? You’d
										have guessed it by now. Yes, it is based on the likelihood of the post that you
										want
										to see first which is calculated based on the past data present in the system.
										The
										data which includes what your interests are,what pages you follow and visit
										frequently. The posts you’ve liked recently, the hashtags you follow or the
										hashtags
										that occur repeatedly in the posts you like and what genre they belong to (e.g.
										travel, food, fashion, sports, etc). Consider you follow 200 pages, but you
										regularly interact with only 30-40 pages. So Instagram prefers to show those
										pages'
										posts to you with higher priority than the remaining 160-170 pages' content.</p>

									<h3>TIMELINESS</h3>
									<p>At the same time, even if you’re inactive for sometime and back, it doesn’t
										suggest posts from the past right? And it shouldn’t. Hence it shows only the
										recent posts that are favoured by you and you want to see first i.e. more
										relevant. This implies that recent posts likely rank higher in your feed and
										that
										the timing of your post is still relevant.

										Instagram algorithm re-orders only the new posts between your current visit and
										your last visit. The posts you visited the last time are not considered for the
										next round of feed display order and hence not shown again, obviously.</p>

									<h3>RELATIONSHIP</h3>
									<p> And no matter how many accounts you follow, you should see your best friend’s
										latest posts. Instagram algorithm studies your past interactions to determine
										your “best friends”. Instagram determines the people you care about by different
										interactions you do within the application.
									<ul>
										<li>People whose content you like (possibly including stories and live videos)
										</li>
										<li>People you direct message</li>
										<li>People you search for</li>
										<li>People you know in real life</li>
									</ul>

									When you search (regularly) for certain profiles, it likely indicates that you
									are interested in the account’s posts and might not have seen them on your feed.

									Instagram might then rank their posts higher on your feed so that you don’t have
									to search for their profiles to see their posts, improving your Instagram
									experience.</p>
									<hr>
									<i>
										<h3>There are also additional criteria that play a smaller part in your
											Instagram
											feed rankings.</h3>
									</i>

									<h3>FREQUENCY</h3>
									<p>Every time a user opens up Instagram, the algorithm will try to show the best
										posts since their last visit. So if you open Instagram once daily, you’ll likely
										see the posts that Instagram’s algorithm feels are the most relevant for that
										day.</p>
									<P>
										However, if you use insta often, you probably won't miss out on anything, right?
									</p>

									<h3>USAGE</h3>
									<p>If a user prefers short visits to Instagram, the algorithm will ensure it shows
										the most relevant posts first, whereas for users who prefer longer browsing
										sessions it may provide a deeper catalog of fresh content to browse.</p>

									<h3>EXPLORE TAB</h3>
									<p>An interesting feature of instagram is the explore tab, that shows varities of
										content. Basically Instagram recognizes accounts that are more or less similar
										to one another by adopting a technique termed as “embedding”.</p>
									<p>

										So to make recommendations, it starts by observing the “seed accounts” which are
										the accounts the users have interacted with in the past.</p>

									<p>It then discovers the accounts that are similar to these and selects 500 pieces
										of content from them.</p>

									<p>These content pieces are then filtered and then the the top 25 posts are ranked
										on the basis of how probable a user is to interact with each one, sent to the
										first page of the user’s explore tab.</p>

									<h3>DEALING WITH SPAM</h3>
									<p>With an abundance of content being shared every day across the app, some of it is
										bound to be spam.</p>

									<p>Now how are these spam messages detected?</p>

									<p>Instagram makes use of Artificial Intelligence’s text analytics algorithm for
										dealing with spam messages.</p>

									<p>Its spam filter can detect spam messages in over 9 languages that include
										English, Arabic, and Chinese. Once detected,

										these messages are automatically removed.</p>

									<h3>CYBER BULLYING?</h3>
									<p>Instagram is considered to be the biggest cyberbullying social media site and
										they became the first to use Machine Learning to automatically remove offensive
										posts.</p>
									<p>
										Based on the text analytics algorithm it identifies spam and removes it. It is a
										solution to identify and eliminate comments that violate Instagram’s Community
										Guidelines.</p>

								<div id="conclusion">
									<h2 style="color: azure;">CONCLUSION</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="entry-summary" style="color: azure;">This makes clear how the time spent on
									Instagram, makes more
									profit for the business by utilizing it properly using modern technologies of
									Artificial
									Intelligence, Machine Learning and Text Analytics. There are multiple other
									industries
									which also make use of user data in the most profitable way and make millions and
									billions. We’ll discuss about such similar industries and businesses in the future.
