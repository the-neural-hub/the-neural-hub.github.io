								</div>
								<div class="entry-summary">
									<p style="color: azure;">This article discusses about another tech giant, a leading
										social media platform with more than two billion daily users. YouTube it is. A
										popular social media platform for sharing and streaming videos not restricted to
										any topic and having over 2 billion users, running successfully since 2005. It
										all stated with the first YouTube video "me at the zoo”. The main reason YouTube
										is still successful and attracting more users everyday is due to the reason of
										right audience attraction and right recommendations that makes it a platform
										with one billion hours of video streaming and sharing everyday.<br><br><br>

								</div>

								<div class="entry-summary" style="color: azure;">


									<p>Just like it’s parent company Google, YouTube also uses ML based algorithms and
										aims to provide the users with relavant,personalized videos. To brief in layman
										terms, the algorithm knows what you already watched and what others similar to
										your liking have watched and gives new recommendations based on this data.</p>
									<br>
									<p>YouTube has multiple sections to interest the user such as the Home, Search,
										Recommended Videos, Trending, and Subscriptions.The YouTube algorithm works in
										all these areas. The algorithm suggests the right video in the feed based on the
										previous history. This algorithm is clearly visible when the user is having the
										watch history turned off vs when it is on. There are clearly better suggestions
										based on the interest, popularity and the region the user is from. Similar to
										the way that Google no longer accepts keyword stuffing, YouTube wants to see
										videos that are created for your audience instead of
										trying to beat the system.</p>
									<br>


									<h3>HOME AND RECOMMENDED RESULTS ALGORITHM</h3>
									<p>The first part of the algorithm for home and recommended videos focuses solely on
										the users’ history. All of the below questions help YouTube select videos that
										are
										custom chosen for the satisfaction of the user.</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											What have they watched before?
										</li>
										<li>
											Do they mostly listen to music?
										</li>
										<li>
											Do they watch vlogs?
										</li>
										<li>
											What channels do they frequently visit?
										</li>

									</ul><br>


									<p> There are also options present in each suggestion in the feed to tell if you’re
										not interested in that video. You can simply click on NOT INTERESTED to not let
										the algorithm suggest such videos in the future.</p>
									<p> Secondly, the algorithm takes into account the interactions between top videos
										and users with similar interests. YouTube, for example, is likely to have a
										group of users who are regularly listening to the same artists and bands. Users
										will then be able to view the top videos viewed by this similar audience and
										those videos will be ranked high for these users. It won't suggest the same
										videos and channels over and over again. As the algorithm understands that users
										are interested in many different things, it will suggest videos based upon
										everything they have previously watched.
									</p>
									<br>

									<h3>TRENDING RESULTS ALGORITHM</h3>
									<p> Trending videos are compiled using an algorithm that pulls down videos that are
										new and popular within a particular country. Users cannot pay to have their
										video shown in trending results since trending videos are never sponsored. Among
										the top trending videos are some that people expect, such as new songs, movie
										trailers but
										others can vary based on factors such as the rate of growth in views and the
										source of those views.


									</p>
									<br>

									<h3>SEARCH RESULTS ALGORITHM</h3>
									<p>In terms of search, video relevance is mostly determined by the relevant keyword
										phrases in the title and description, as well as the total duration of the
										video. It is obvious that the algorithm wants to make sure that the keyword used
										by you in your search is in the video's title and/or description when it
										delivers the video results. Furthermore, the algorithm also considers whether a
										user has ever watched a video on a given channel before.</p>


									<br>

									<h3>SUBSCRIPTION RESULTS ALGORITHM</h3>
									<p>
										YouTube uses view velocity to rank subscribed channel results, which is a number
										that quantifies how many subscribers watch a channel video right after it has
										been published. Videos will be ranked higher depending on how high 'view
										velocity' is. When determining an order of videos, YouTube takes into account a
										channel's number of subscribers!
									</p><br>

									<div class="entry-summary" style="color: azure;">
										<h3 style="text-align:center">Not only does the algorithm help the viewers to
											get
											the right video to spend
											their leisure time, but also helps the content creators to make their video
											rank
											higher among others with some tips that follow.</h3><br>

										<p><i style="font-weight: bold;">Tip to get featured in “Home” page - </i>You
											should strive to maintain user engagement as long as possible. No matter
											how
											long or short your videos are, keeping your audience interested and engaged
											should be your main objective.
										</p>



										<p><i style="font-weight: bold;">Tip to rank higher in the “Trending” section -
											</i>

											For your videos to appear in Trending, you should produce content that is
											broadly
											relatable, appealing, and easy to share.</p>

										<p><i style="font-weight: bold;">Tip to rank higher in the “Search” results -
											</i>

											For your videos, make sure the description contains the keyword in the
											extended
											description, but don't keyword stuff or write irrelevant content.</p>

										<p><i style="font-weight: bold;">Tip to improve in the “Subscription” results -
											</i>

											Be genuine when you ask for subscribers. Your subscribers will be much more
											likely to watch your channel if you explain why subscribing to your channel
											is
											beneficial for them.</p>

									<div id="conclusion">
										<h2 style="color: azure;">CONCLUSION</h2>
									</div>
									<div class="entry-summary" style="color: azure;">
										With the very existence of Youtube through website, mobile applications and
										network television, it has helped and enabled the society to more directly
										engage with Youtube creators such as TEDTalks, celebrities and even assists in
										promoting politics. Along with the above mentioned algorithms, there are few
										beneficial applications that Youtube heavily focus on such as fake news, "Up
										Next" feature and etc. Thus, the Artifical Intelligence plays a pivotal role in
										the Google's online video sharing platform.
