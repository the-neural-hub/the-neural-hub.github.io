									<h2 style="color: azure;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="entry-summary">
									<p style="color: azure;">In the previous post about <a
											href="article-ig.html">Instagram</a>, we’ve seen how
										effectively the user data is used to curate the feed for each profile based on
										the personal interests and likings. As mentioned in the previous post, this post
										is also related to another use case of Machine Learning and AI in the real time
										industry. This is another successful organisation, to be more specific it is a
										digital streaming company winning in the entertainment industry among its
										competitors. YES! We are going to see about the use of data in Netflix, one of
										the
										giants in the entertainment industry. </p>
									<br>
									<p style="color: azure;">NETFLIX earned its reputation as one of media's most
										successful brands through maintaining a good balance between automation and
										human interaction. What truly makes Netflix stand out is its unmatched
										recommendation system, which utilizes AI capabilities to improve the brand’s
										product offering and the user experience. We also know that the recommendation
										system was solely responsible for Netflix’s success in its initial days. By
										providing personalized content recommendations, it became very user friendly and
										encouraged the user to continue in this platform even when new companies
										emerged.</p>
									<br>

									<p style="color: azure;">
										First started out as a DVD rental service, the American digital streaming
										service has now expanded to an array of digital content. With more than 208
										million subscribers around the world, it is currently the largest streaming
										service.

									<h3>PERSONALIZATION OF MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
									<p>The principle behind the working of recommendation system is Users who watch X
										are most likely to watch Y. This is the most well known feature of Netflix. The
										X and Y are nothing but the shows or movies streamed on the platform. </p>
									<p>In order to keep you on the platform, Netflix uses the watch history of other
										users with similar tastes to offer recommendations for what you may be most
										interested in viewing next. Which means if you are watching a sequence of funny
										series on Netflix, it uses the data of other users who have the similar viewing
										history and uses that to recommend the next set of shows for you.</p>
									<br>
									<h3 style="text-align:center">But the recommendation algorithm does not stop with
										this, the best is coming next.</h3><br>


									<h3>AUTO-GENERATION AND PERSONALIZATION OF THUMBNAILS / ARTWORK</h3>
									<p>Using the movie’s original art as the only thumbnail for every single person most
										likely won’t yield the highest click through rates. Every person viewing the
										same poster isn’t going to watch the movie for sure. But if the movie has some
										part of the story, which resembles the user’s liking, that can be used in the
										movie poster to lure the user into watching that particular movie/series. Here
										comes the role of personalized movie posters/ thumbnails.</p><br>

									<h3>HOW TO CREATE A DIFFERENT THUMBNAIL FOR EACH USER THAT IS OPTIMIZED TO INCREASE
										CLICK RATES?</h3>
									<p> Using thousands of video frames from an existing movie or show as a starting
										point , Netflix adds tags to these images then ranks each image in an effort to
										identify which thumbnails have the highest likelihood of resulting in your
										click. It is calculated by looking at what other people, who are similar to you,
										have clicked on. It is possible that users favoring certain actors or movie
										genres are more likely to click thumbnails with those actors or image
										attributes.</p><br>

									<h3>HOW DOES NETFLIX CREATE THESE PERSONALIZED THUMBNAILS / ARTWORK?</h3>
									<p> A single episode with a running duration of one hour has more than 86,000 static
										video frames in it.

										These video frames can each individually be assigned certain tags that are
										used to filter down to the best thumbnail candidates through a set of tools and
										algorithms called Aesthetic Visual Analysis (AVA). This is designed to find the
										best custom thumbnail image out of every static frame of the video.
									<ul>
										<li>
											<bold>Netflix Annotation</bold> — Netflix creates metadata for each frame
											including
											brightness (.67), # of faces (3) , skin tones (.2), probability of nudity
											(.03), level of motion blur (4), symmetry (.4)
										</li>
										<li>
											<bold>Netflix Image Ranking</bold> — Netflix now picks out specific images
											that are
											highest and most clickable based on the user profile
										</li>

									</ul>

									</p>
									<br>

									<h3>PRODUCT CONSIDERATIONS IN PERSONALIZED IMAGE THUMBNAILS</h3>
									<p>Using the clicking behavior of other people who have similar interests, it can
										make use of that data and the other user’s watch history and their click through
										rate for a given thumbnail to recommend it for a new user who hasn’t seen the
										particular movie/thumbnail yet.</p>

									<p> Since Netflix has data on clicking behavior of other people with similar
										interests, it is reasonable to guess that if other people with similar interests
										and watch history had a high click through rate on a certain thumbnail, then it
										is likely that this image thumbnail will perform well on a new person who hasn’t
										yet been recommended this movie / thumbnail.</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											It is possible that the recommended thumbnails would all appear similar and
											less appealing if they were optimized to look the same. Considering each
											thumbnail along with the other presentation will be key.
										</li>
										<li>
											It should take into account what thumbnails the user previously viewed in
											association with this video and provide a seamless, cohesive experience with
											this movie.
										</li>

									</ul>
									<br>

									<h3>HOW DOES NETFLIX TARGET THESE CUSTOM-CREATED THUMBNAILS TO THE APPROPRIATE
										INDIVIDUAL?</h3>
									<p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Number of movies previously watched by the user.
										</li>
										<li>
											Number of minutes of each show watched.
										</li>
										<li>
											Percentage of completion for every video/series watched so far.
										</li>
										<li>
											Number of upvotes, which movies were favorited, etc.
										</li>
										<li>
											Any seasonal or weekly trends related to a user’s level of engagement, etc.
										</li>


									</ul><br>
									</p>

									<h3>HOW DOES THIS GROUPING OF SIMILAR USER PROFILES WORK AND HOW DOES A PRODUCT
										MANAGER MAKE SENSE OF THE DATA?</h3>
									<p>You see, they use this grouping of profiles to create a 360-degree profile of
										every user and mathematically rank each one based on hundreds, perhaps thousands
										of different attributes.

										Using such data, they are able to predict the likely behavior of other users
										based on the behavior of one user.</p>
									<p>

										In this grouping mechanism, each Netflix user’s profile could be described
										through numerical values depicting their interest in certain aspects — such as
										the movie genre, favorite stars, or the movie topic considering each as an
										individual dimension.</p>

									<p>By using these relations and groupings, the appearance of related interest groups
										would indicate a closer relationship, so it becomes more easy and effective to
										recommend shows more likely to be seen by the user.</p>

								<div id="conclusion">
									<h2 style="color: azure;">CONCLUSION</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="entry-summary" style="color: azure;">We’ve seen how an industrial giant like
									Netflix leverages AI and ML to grow exponentially and grow its audience base through
									effective use of modern technologies.

									<p>No algorithm is perfect, there are also situations where Netflix overdoes the
										requirements and doesn’t perform well. Though it is one of the best in the
										industry.
										But everything comes at a cost and maybe, that’s why Netflix subscriptions are
										expensive. Let’s learn from this story, how user data plays an effective role in
										enhancing the user experience and the business growth.</p>
